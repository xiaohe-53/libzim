libzim 6.3.0
============

 * Rewrite internal reader structure to use stream decompression.
   This allow libzim to not decompresse the whole cluster to get an article
   content. This is big performance improvement, it speedups random access by
   2, with a very small cost when doing "full" incremental reading
   (zim-check/zim-dump). (@veloman-yunkan)
 * Better dirent lookup.
   Dirent lookup is the process of locating article data starting from the url
   or title. This improves reading of zim file up to 10% (@veloman-yunkan)
 * Add basic, first version of `validate` function to check internal structure
   of a zim file. (@veloman-yunkan, @MiguelRocha)
 * Fix compilation of libzim without xapian (@mgautierfr)
 * Remove zlib dependency (and support of very old files created using zlib
   compression) (@mgautierfr)
 * New unit tests and various small fixes.

     files.
   - mimetypes are limited to 944 bytes.
 * Add a new type of iterator to iterate over articles in a performant way
   reducing decompression of clusters. This is now the new default iterator.

 * Fix handling of big cluster (>4GiB) on 32 bits architecture. This is mainly
 done by :
   * Do not mmap the whole cluster by default.
   * MMap only the memory asociated to an article.
   * If an article is > 4GiB, the blob associated to it is invalid
     (data==size==0).
   * Other information are still valid (directAccessInformation, ...)
 * Fix writing of extended cluster in writer.
 * Compile libzim on macos.
 * Build libzim setting RPATH.
 * Search result urls are now what is stored in the zim file. They should not
   start with a `/`. This is a revert of the change made in last release.
   (See kiwix/kiwix-lib#123)
 * Spelling corrections in README.

   (kiwix/kiwix-lib#110)
 * Open the file readonly when checking the zim file (and so be able to check
   read only file).
 * Accept absolute url starting with '/' when searching for article.
 * Fix various bugs

libzim 3.1.0
============

 * Lzma is not a optional dependency anymore.
 * Better handle (report and not crash) invalid zim file.
 * Embed source of gtest (used only if gtest is not available on the system)
 * Move zimDump tools out of libzim repository to zim-tools
 * ZimCreator tools doesn't not read command line to set options.

libzim 3.0.0
============

This is a major change of the libzim.
Expect a lot new improvement and API changes.

 * Add a suggestion mode to the search
 * Fix licensing issues
 * Fix wrong stemming of the query when searching
 * Deactivate searching (and so crash) in the embedded database if the zim is
   splitted
 * Rewrite the low level memory management of libzim when reading a zim file:
    * We use a buffer base entity to handle memory and reading file instead of
      reading file using stream.
    * MMap the memory when posible to avoid memory copy.
    * Use const when posible (API break)
 * Move to googletest instead of cxxtools for unit-tests.
 * Fix endiannes bug on arm.
 * Do not install private headers. Those headers declare private structure and
   should not be visible (API break)
 * Compile libzim with `-Werror` and `-Wall` options.
 * Make libzim thread safe for reading article.
   The search part is not thread safe, and all search operation must be
   protected by a lock.
 * Add method to get only a part of a article.
 * Move some tools to zim-tools repository.


libzim 2.0.0
============

 * Move to meson build system
   `libzim` now use `meson` as build system instead of `autotools`
 * Move to C++11Â standard.
 * Fulltext search in zim file.
   We have integrated the xapian fulltext search in libzim.
   So now, libzim provide an API to search in a zim containing embeded fulltext
   index. This means that :
    *libzim need xapian as (optional) dependencies (if you want compile with
     xapian support).
    * The old and unused search API has been removed.
 * Remove bzip2 support.
 * Remove Symbian support.
 * Few API hanges
   * Make some header files private (not installed);
   * A `Blob` can now be cast to a `string` directly;
   * Change a lot of `File` methods to const methods.
